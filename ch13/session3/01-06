Which fields in Exercises 1-6 are conservative, and which are not?

1. F = (yz)i + (xz)j + (xy)k

	M = yz, N = xz, P = xy

	∂N/∂z = x = ∂P/∂y
	∂M/∂y = z = ∂N/∂x
	∂P/∂x = y = ∂M/∂z

	so it's conservative

3. F = (y)i + (x + z)j + (-y)k

	M = y, N = x + z, P = -y

	∂N/∂z = 1 != ∂P/∂y

	so it is not conservative

5. F = (z + y)i + (z)j + (y + x)k

	M = z + y, N = z, P = y + x

	∂N/∂z = 1 = ∂P/∂y
	∂M/∂y = 1 != ∂N/∂x

	so it is not conservative
