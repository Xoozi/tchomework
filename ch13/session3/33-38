33. a. Exact differential form
       How are the constant a, b, and c related if the following differential form is exact

      (ay² + 2czx)dx + (y(bx + cz))dy + (ay² + cx²) dz

      M = ay² + 2czx
      N = y(bx + cz)
      P = ay² + cx²

      ∂N/∂z = yc = ∂P/∂y = 2ay

      => c = 2a

      ∂M/∂y = 2ay = ∂N/∂x = by
      => 2a = b

      ∂M/∂z = 2cx = ∂P/∂x = 2cx


      => c = 2a = b

    b. Gradient field
       For what values of b and c will
       F = (y² + 2czx)i + y(bx + cz)j + (y² + cx²)k
       be a gradient field

       a = 1 
       c = b = 2a = 2

       F = (y² + 4zx)i + (2yx + 2yz)j + (y² + 2x²)k



35. Path of least work
    You have been asked to find the path along which a force field F
    will perform the least work in moving a particle between two location.
    A quick calculation on your part shows F to be conservative. How sould you 
    repsond? Give reasons for your answer.

    Path is independed, all path do the same work



37. Work by a constant force
    Show that the work done by a constant force field F = ai + bj + ck in moving a particle along any
    path from A to B is W = F·AB


	F = ai + bj + ck
	M = a
	N = b
	P = c

	∂N/∂z = 0 = ∂P/∂y
	∂M/∂y = 0 = ∂N/∂x
	∂P/∂x = 0 = ∂M/∂z

	and work done by F, form A to B on the line segment is F·AB	

	so work done by F is path independed = F·AB
