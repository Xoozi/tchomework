Let C be the boundary of a region on which Green's Theorem holds. Use Green's Theorem to calculate

a. ∮ f(x)dx + g(y)dy

    M(x, y) = f(x), ∂M/∂y = 0
    N(x, y) = g(y), ∂N/∂x = 0

    = ∬ ∂N/∂x - ∂M/∂y dxdy = 0

b. ∮ ky dx + hx dy   (k and h constants)

    M(x, y) = ky, ∂M/∂y = k
    N(x, y) = hx, ∂N/∂x = h

    = ∬ ∂N/∂x - ∂M/∂y dxdy = ∬ (h - k) dxdy = (h - k) * area of R
