Green's Theorem and Laplace's equation
Assuming that all the necessary derivatives exist and are continuous,
show that if f(x, y) satisfies the Laplace equation
    
    ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² = 0

then

    ∮ ∂f/∂y dx - ∂f/∂x dy = 0

for all closed curves C to which Green's Theorem apples.

if
    M = ∂f/∂y,  ∂M/∂y = ∂²f/∂y²
    N = -∂f/∂x, ∂N/∂x = -∂²f/∂x²


    ∮ Mdx + Ndy = ∬ ∂N/∂x - ∂M/∂y dxdy = ∬ -∂²f/∂x² - ∂²f/∂y² dxdy = 0
