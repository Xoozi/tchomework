Find the work done by F in moving a particle once counterclockwise
around the given curve

15. F = 2xy**3i + 4x²y²j

C: The boundary of the triangular region in the first quadrant 
    enclosed by the x-axis, the line x = 1 ,and the curve y = x**3


    M = 2xy**3, ∂M/∂y = 6xy²
    N = 4x²y²,  ∂N/∂x = 8xy²


    work = ∮ Mdx + Ndy = ∬ (∂N/∂x - ∂M/∂y) dxdy = ∬ 2xy² dxdy = ∫(0, 1) ∫(0, x**3) 2xy² dydx
    = ∫(0, 1) [2/3 xy**3]|(0, x**3) dx = ∫(0, 1) 2/3 x**10 dx = 2/33
