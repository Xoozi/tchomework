Area as a line integral
Show that if R is a region in the plane bounded by a piecewise-smooth simple closed curve C, then

Area of R = ∮ xdy = -∮ ydx

    if ∮ xdy = - ∮ ydx

    then
        ∮ xdy + ydx = 0

    if 
    M = y,
    N = x

        ∮ Mdx + Ndy = ∬ ∂N/∂x - ∂M/∂y dxdy = ∬ 1 - 1 dxdy = 0


        xoozi 这个题技巧性提升得有点陡啊< 另外, 这也是公开课里说的面积计的工作原理吧

        1) if M = x, N = 0

            ∮ Mdy - Ndx =  ∮ xdy = ∬ ∂M/∂x + ∂N/∂y dxdy = ∬ 1 dxdy = Area of R

        2) if N = y, M = 0

            ∮ Mdy - Ndx = ∮ -ydx = ∬ ∂M/∂x + ∂N/∂y dxdy = ∬ 1 dxdy = Area of R
