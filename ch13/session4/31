Area and the centroid

Let A be the area and x' the x-coordinate of the centroid of a region R
that is bounded by a piecewisesmooth simple closed curve C in the xy-plane.
Show that:

1/2 ∮ x² dy = -∮ xy dx = 1/3 ∮ x²dy - xy dx = Ax'


if F = Mi + Nj

M = x², ∂M/∂x = 2x
N = xy, ∂N/∂y = x

(1)
1/2 ∮ x² dy = -∮ xy dx

=> 1/2 ∮ x²dy = 1/3 ∮ x² dy - xy dx = 1/3 ∬ 3x dxdy = ∬ x dxdy = My

x' = My/∬ 1 dxdy
=> My = Ax'
