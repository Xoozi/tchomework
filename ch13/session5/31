Find the outward flux of the field F = (2xy)i + (2yz)j +(2xz)k
across the surface of the cube cut form the first octant by the xlane x = a, y = a, z = a


	S1 	x = 0
		n = -i
		F · n = -2xy = 0

		flux = ∬ -2xy dA = 0

	S2	x = a
		n = i
		F · n = 2xy = 2ay

		flux = a∬ 2y dydz 
		= a ∫(0, a) y²|(0, a) dz
		= a**3 ∫(0, a) dz
		= a**4


	S3	y = 0
		n = -j

		F · n = -2yz = 0

		flux = 0

	S4	y = a
		n - j
		F · n = 2yz = 2az

		flux = a ∬ 2z dzdx = a**4


	so flux = 3 * a**4
