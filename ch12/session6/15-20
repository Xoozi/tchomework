Finding Iterated Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates

In 15-20, set up the iterated integral  for evaluating 
∫∫∫(D) f(r, θ, z) over the given region D


15. D is the right circular cylinder whose base is r = 2sinθ in 
	the xy-plane and whose top lies in the plane z = 4-y

	∫(0, π) ∫(0, 2sinθ) ∫(0, 4-rsinθ) f(r, θ, z) dz r drdθ

17. D is the solid right cylinder whose base is the region in 
	the xy-plane that lies inside the cardioid r = 1 + cosθ
	and outside the circle r = 1 and whose top lies in the 
	plane z = 4

	∫(-π/2, π/2) ∫(1, 1+cosθ) ∫(0, 4) f(r, θ, z) dz r dr dθ

19. D is the prism whoses base is the triangle in the xy-plane
	bounded by the x-axis and the line y = x, and x = 1
	and whose top lies in the plane z = 2-y

	∫(0, π/4) ∫(0, 1/cosθ) ∫(0, 2-r*sinθ) dz r dr dθ
