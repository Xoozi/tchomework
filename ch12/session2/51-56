Pappus' Formula

Pappus knew that the centroid of the union of two nonoverlapping
plane region lies on the line segment joining their individual
centroid. More specifically, suppose that m1 and m2 are the masses
of thin plates P1 and P2 that cover nonoverlapping regions in the 
xy-plane. Let c1 and c2 be the vectors from the origin to the respective
center of mass of P1 and P2. Then the center of mass of the union
P1 âˆª P2 of the two plates is determined by the vector:

    c = (m1c1 + m2c2)/(m1 + m2)         (9)


generalizes

    c = (m1c1 + m2c2 + ... + mncn)/(m1 + m2 + ... + mn) (10)



51. Derive (9)

    M = m1 + m2

    Mx = m1*c1.y + m2*c2.y
    My = m1*c1.x + m2*c2.x

    c.x = My/M = (m1*c1.x + m2*c2.x)/(m1 + m2)
    c.y = Mx/M = (m1*c1.y + m2*c2.y)/(m1 + m2)

    so  
    c = (m1c1 + m2c2)/(m1 + m2)
