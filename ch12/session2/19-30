19. find the center of mass of a thin plate of density δ = 3 bounded by 
the line x = 0, y = x, and parabola y = 2 - x² in the first quadrant 

    M   = ∫(0, 1) ∫(x, 2 - x²) 3 dy dx
        = ∫(0, 1) (3y)|(x, 2 - x²) dx
        = 3 ∫(0, 1) 2 - x² - x dx
        = 3 (2x - x³/3 - x²/2)|(0, 1)
        = 3*(2 - 1/3 - 1/2)
        = 6 - 1 - 3/2
        = 7/2

    Mx  = ∫(0, 1) ∫(x, 2 - x²) y dy dx
        = ∫(0, 1) (y²/2)|(x ,2 - x²) dx
        = ∫(0
