The Parallel Axis Theorem


Let Lc.m be a line in the xy-plane that runs through the center of mass
of a thin plate of mass m covering a region in the plane, Let L be a line
in the plane parallel to and h units away from Lc.m. The Parallel Axis 
Theorem says that under these condition the moments of inertia IL and
Ic.m of the plate about L and Lc.m satisfy the equation:
    IL = Ic.m + mh²

This equation gives a quick way to calculate on moment when the other
moment and the mass are known.

49. Proof of the Parallel Axis Theorem

a.Show that the first moment of a thin flat plate about any line in
the plane of the plate through the plate's center of mass is zero

    cx = My/M = 0 => My = ∫∫(R) x δ(x,y) dA = 0


b. Use the result in (a) to derive the Parallel Axis Theorem Assume that
the plane is coordinatized in a way that makes Lc.m. the y-axis and L
the line x = h, Then expand the integrand of the integral of IL to rewrite
the integral as the sum of inegrals whose values you recongnize

    IL = ∫∫(R) (x - h)² δ(x,y) dA = ∫∫(R) x² δ(x, y) dA - 2h ∫∫(R) x δ(x, y) dA + ∫∫(R) h² δ(x, y) dA
    = Iy - 2h0 + h²∫∫(R) δ(x, y) dA
    = Iy + h²m
    = Ic.m + mh²
