Among al the points on the graph of z = 10 - x² - y² 

that lie above the plane x + 2y + 3z = 0, find the point 

farthest from the plane

N = i + 2j + 3k

normalize(N) = (1/sqrt(14))i + (2/sqrt(14)j + (3/sqrt(14)k

if P(x, y, z)

P distance to plane is 
dis = dot(P, nN) = 1/sqrt(14)(x + 2y + 3z)

is equilent
