find two numbers a and b, with a <= b, such that ∫(a, b) (6 - x - x²) dx has its largets value

    F(x) = 6x - x²/2 - x³/3

    F(b)  - F(a)

    xoozi 这题有意思

    if F(a, b) = ∫(a, b) (6 - x - x²) dx = (6b - b²/2 - b³/3) - (6a - a²/2 - a³/3)

    Fa = -6 + a + a², 
    Fb = 6 - b - b²

    0 = -6 + a + a² => a = -3 or a = 2
    0 = 6 - b - b² => b = -3, or b = 2

    a <= b =>
    F(a, b) max is F(-3, 2)
