Tangent curves

A smooth curve is tangent to the surface at a point of 
intersection if its velocity vector is orthogonal to ∇f there

show that the curve

r(t) = sqrt(t)i + sqrt(t)j + (2t - 1)k

is the tangent to the surface x² + y² - z = 1, when t = 1


v(t) = 1/2sqrt(t) i + 1/2sqrt(t) j + 2k


∇f = 2xi + 2yj - k

dot(∇f, v(t)) = sqrt(t)/sqrt(t) + sqrt(t)/sqrt(t) - 2 = 0

so
