Zero directional derivative
In what direction is the derivative of f(x, y) = xy + y² at P(3, 2) equal to zero

    ∇f
    = ∂f/∂x i + ∂f/∂y j
    = (y)i + (x + 2y)j
    = 2i + 7j

    if u = u1i + u2j

    u · ∇f = 0

    2u1 + 7u2 = 0
    u1² + u2² = 1

    u = 7/sqrt(53)i - 2/sqrt(53)j
        or
    u = -7/sqrt(53)i + 2/sqrt(53)j
